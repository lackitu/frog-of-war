## Frog of War is an arcade-style game where players control Kratos (or Atreus) as they navigate dangerous terrains across the Nine Realms. Players dodge mythological enemies, environmental hazards, and use Kratos' Leviathan Axe or Atreus' bow to overcome obstacles. Each level is themed around a different realm, with unique challenges and enemies to face. The game blends classic Frogger-style mechanics with God of War's brutal world, offering fast-paced action and strategic gameplay.

## This game is designed for anyone who loves to play frogger but is also a big fan of god of war

## In this game we want to bring a fun and popular skin idea to life wth an interesting classic

## Some key features are its theme, based in a mythical setting, obstacles like what would normally be logs or cars with flowing rivers, there would be moving weapons, lava rivers, and giant mythological creatures like hydras or dragons. 
## Another feature is its character design, The frog being styled like kratos with a tiny axe and some war paint. Also the introduction of sidekick animals with a frog version of Arteus.
## Some power ups and abilitys would include, "Rage Mode", triggers spartan rage for a short amount of time and you can smash through obstacles. Another abiltiy would be "leap of faith" where you get an ultra jump and "Shield Mode" to briefly block hazards.

## As you go through the game you explore many different levels with varying themes and obstacles, Like different mythological landscapes, from Midgard to Olympus. 

## Some things that we could strive for to feel like our game is a hit are things like, high retention rates, playtime and session length, level completion rates, etc.

## For technical requirements this game could run on any computer with a dedicated application window.
## Some simple keyboard controls would be implemented to make sure that our game is simple and accessible to anyone

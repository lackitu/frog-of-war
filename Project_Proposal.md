# **FROG OF WAR**   
## In Frog of War, players control Kratos (or Atreus) as they navigate treacherous landscapes inspired by the Nine Realms of Norse mythology. Dodging colossal enemies like trolls, giants, and hellwalkers, as well as dangerous environmental hazards such as lava flows and ice floes, the goal is to reach a safe zone or complete a series of challenges. Using Kratosâ€™ mighty Leviathan Axe and Atreus' bow, players can temporarily freeze enemies, stun creatures, or create new paths to avoid danger. Each level is set in a different realm, with unique obstacles, enemies, and environmental effects to keep players on their toes. Frog of War blends classic arcade-style gameplay with the brutal, epic world of God of War, offering a fast-paced, mythological twist on the Frogger formula.

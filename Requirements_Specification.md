## BS AI Game Overview

Frog of War is an arcade-style game where players control Kratos (or Atreus) as they navigate dangerous terrains across the Nine Realms. Players dodge mythological enemies, environmental hazards, and use Kratos' Leviathan Axe or Atreus' bow to overcome obstacles. Each level is themed around a different realm, with unique challenges and enemies to face. The game blends classic Frogger-style mechanics with God of War's brutal world, offering fast-paced action and strategic gameplay.
